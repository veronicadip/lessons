<!--
    1. Define the basic HTML tags in button.html
    2. Write a button that looks and behaves like the "sign up" button in dribbble.com

    Tips:
        - You're allowed to inspect the element, you'll have to explain later how you did it
        - Pay attention to hover, and active states << google first, ask if you don't understand
