      Create two components:

      1. <List /> that receives an array of strings as prop
         and renders a list of things
      2. <Filter /> that receives an array of strings and:
          i.   Renders a list of tings using <List />
          ii.  Has an <input> in which you can enter a string
          iii. The input works as a search: if you type something
               in there, the elements that doesn't start with what
               you typed are removed from the list

      Hints:

        - Remember that arrays have a `filter` method
        - Remember that strings have a `startsWith` method
        - Remember that you already know how to listen for input changes
