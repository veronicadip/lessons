/** a function is a piece of code that you can write in different ways. Once you have it, you can call
 * it any time and it will do different things depending on what you coded. For example
 * you can make booleans, you can make it return the thing that you need (it can be a simple
 * string or even another piece of code), you can make a loop, or even call another function.
 * you can also write an arrow function; it is a shorter way to do it but it have some differences.
 */

/**new definition: a function is a piece of code that you can write to call it later, this way you can avoid
 * repeating the same thing multiple times.
 * functions can receive multiple parameters (but you can run a function without one parameter at all) and have a
 * piece of code that is executed every time you call the function (using the parameters you give to it on
 * each case). The return statement determines what is the function returning after all the process it made.
