// Let's say we're the creators of React and we're building React.Component
// your other teammates will be coding the rest of the logic, but your task
// is to implement the `setState` function
//
// Hints:
// 1. it doesn't have to be perfect, this is an imaginary scenario
// 2. think about what setState does and try to mimic that

class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props
    this.state = {}
  }

  setState = (newState) => {
    state = {newState}
    render() {
      return state
    }
    }
  }
