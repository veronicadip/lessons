            <p>The three of us had been snacking for the better part of the early afternoon, filling a table with everything we could carry. Crackers both fancy and goldfish, multiple cheeses, winter mandarins, two kinds of smoked salmon, smoked cod, chocolate, three kinds of chips, an exceedingly mediocre store-bought hummus that we tried and failed to spruce up with lemon, smoked paprika, garlic, and salt.</p>
            <p>One of us mentioned off-handedly that she always keeps dill and parsley in her fridge and that she makes a thing with it that she described as having only a few ingredients and being able to go on anything. “Hm…maybe I’ll make it?” she said getting up from the table and heading into the kitchen. It was my first time meeting her. She was a friend of a friend, but I knew her a little from online. She used to run an inspirational food nonprofit that I saw stories about in local news. It shuttered during the pandemic. She was now working as a costume designer on a TV show shooting locally.</p>
            <p>She located a salad spinner (it was not her kitchen) and took out an unusually large and verdant bunch of Italian flat-leaf parsley. I watched as she separated each strand of parsley, briefly inspecting it and setting aside the less than acceptable ones while she told us the story of her trip to her mother’s homeland.</p>
            <p>She described rocky failing roads, bumpy pickup trucks, small villages where the women looked so much like her mother that it brought her to tears. A village elder who spoke no English, and lived in a tiny shelter that he shared with his livestock, into which he invited her to drink and laugh at the bare table. She was the guest of honor.</p>
            <p>I watched as she worked over the herbs. After she had reduced the pile by about 5% by taking out the slightly wilted ones, she began to take the leaves from the stalk. Individually. There was no hurry to the way she worked, nor was there speed. <mark class="green-mark">She peeled each leaf as if we had all day to peel leaves. We did not. But it was then that I realized that we did.</mark></p>
            <p>I found myself mesmerized with the slowness. If I am ever tasked with making something out of herbs, my method is to rinse them, chop them, throw them into the dish and then move on to the next thing. My mind kept stuttering over the fact that she was taking so long, almost as if there were something wrong with how long she was taking, though I could not name what it was.</p>
            <p>Her story had become funny. Something about finding a poster of a shirtless Kanye wearing a gold cross in a remote and unlikely place in her family’s village. We were laughing. She had done such a good job of painting the characters in the story that when I think back on that moment it seems odd that there were only three of us in the room. I seem to remember there being dozens of us, a whole dinner party, in fact. She moved on to the dill, repeating the same process: rinsing, drying, picking over, peeling each leaf with painstaking attention.</p>

            <p>Now she was describing a feast that was made for her. Her visit had coincided with the celebration of a local baby. Where her people are from, she explained, it is forbidden to see the baby before it has survived for 90 days. She happened to arrive to the village on the baby’s the 90th day and relatives from near and far had come to celebrate these twin blessings. The alcohol was flowing. There was laughter and music. She thought the food would be presented in some formal way at some point, but she soon learned that the food just kept coming. Dish after dish after dish after dish. Everything was delicious. “The thing is,” she explained fiddling with and then fixing the salad spinner which had gone off the track, “it’s considered rude to have any part of the table that doesn’t have food on it. So, like if there’s, like, even a space this big,” and here she took her hands from he fresh, wet dill and demonstrated a shape roughly the size of a small paperback book “someone will, like, put a lemon wedge or some leaves on a dish just to fill up that space.” It was here that I noticed how the fuchsia of her nails made gorgeous asymmetry with the green of the dill.</p>
            <p>Soon she was mixing the herbs in a small bowl with salt and olive oil and red pepper flakes. Considering the labor that had gone into it, the final product struck me as a remarkably small amount of food. I found myself once again trying to understand where this constant measure of efficiency and output was coming from inside me. It was a Saturday. We were ostensibly on a mini vacation. I did not have a place to be, nor a time to be there. I tried to imagine working this slowly in my home kitchen and I could not. I love cooking. I am good at cooking. But lately cooking had become a means to an end, a short work break that also makes it possible for me to eat, a thing that makes a mess and takes up time, a thing that I’d have to wrap up quickly so I could get back to work. It occurred to me that this person was treating the preparing of food as the meal in and of itself.</p>
            <p>“I just like it,” she explained as if she was reading my thoughts, “because when I was little this is all my mother and aunts would let me do. ‘Take the leaves off the herbs,’ they would say, ‘take the leaves off the herb.’ So when I smell these herbs, it reminds me of them.”</p>
            <p>She took a few more tastes, made a few more adjustments. When she was done, we each scooped a little spoonful of the stuff onto toasted rye bread with some smoked fish on it. It was good. Not mind blowing. Just good. Very good. Good enough that I thought about it that night when I went to bed and in the morning when I woke up. Good enough that I wrote about it. Good enough that I decided to remember that it happened.</p>

            <p>It is nearly Lunar New Year, when the night sky is unlit by the moon, the one period of time in which you can rest from your work in the fields. So, you use it to join with the people you love. You come to them and they to you with gifts. You bring joy to them. You hope for good blessings.</p>
            <p>My good blessing this new year has been story and a pair of hands that touched each leaf as if each leaf were a loving living thing, as if I deserved to eat things that had been loved in this way.</p>
            <p>In the quiet of this new year, in the cold of the nights wherever you are, I hope you know that you too deserve to eat things that have been loved in this way, to hear stories in which each word, each sentence has been caressed in the luminescent glow of afternoon sunlight, trimmed and lacquered in sparkling fuchsia.</p>
            <p>I hope you know you deserve that, and that you always have.</p>
